# CPHG_PRS
The files here contain simulated training data (train.bed, train.bim, train.fam), target data (target.bed, target.bim, target.fam), and association results / base data (Association_Results.glm.logistic.hybrid) for performing a PRS analysis. The data was simulated under a null model in HAPGEN2 with a 1000 Genomes Phase 3 European reference. 10,000 SNPs from chromosome 22 were selected for simulation.
